# WalletConnectKit

![Status](https://github.com/pink-room/walletconnectkit-android/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)

`WalletConnectKit` is the Swiss Army toolkit for `WalletConnect`! It will allow you to connect your
DApp with an Ethereum Wallet in a few minutes and start performing transactions right away.

**Note:** Currently, we only support the v1 protocol of `WalletConnect`, since it is the protocol
that most Wallets implement. As soon as Wallets implement the v2 protocol and the`WalletConnect`
library for Kotlin is stable, we will support the v2 protocol.

## Installation

``` groovy
implementation 'com.github.mubeen017:pinkroom-walletconnectkit-android:1.0'

```

## Setup

First, you need to create a config:

```kotlin
val config = WalletConnectKitConfig(
    context = this,
    bridgeUrl = "wss://bridge.aktionariat.com:8887",
    appUrl = "walletconnectkit.com",
    appName = "WalletConnectKit",
    appDescription = "WalletConnectKit is the Swiss Army toolkit for WalletConnect!"
)
```

**Note:** The bridge url provided above is a deployed version of
[this](https://github.com/aktionariat/walletconnect-bridge) repo by its owner. Feel free to use it
or use your own bridge server.

Then, build the `WalletConnectKit` instance:

```kotlin
val walletConnectKit = WalletConnectKit.Builder(config).build()
```

And you are ready to go! ðŸš€

## Connect Button

Add the `WalletConnectButton` to your layout:

```xml

<dev.pinkroom.walletconnectkit.WalletConnectButton
    android:id="@+id/walletConnectButton"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Start the button with the previously created `WalletConnectKit` instance. When the account is
successfully connected, you will receive the account address.

```kotlin
walletConnectButton.start(walletConnectKit) { address ->
    println("You are connected with account: $address")
}
```

Or:

```kotlin
walletConnectButton.start(walletConnectKit, ::onConnected, ::onDisconnected)
```

```kotlin
private fun onConnected(address: String) {
    println("You are connected with account: $address")
}

private fun onDisconnected() {
    println("Account disconnected!")
}
```


**Note:** `WalletConnectButton` is an `ImageButton` with a default theme that can be overridden by
you!

If you want to be informed about the status of the `WalletConnect` session, you can set a
`Session.Callback` before calling the `start` method.

```kotlin
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity(), Session.Callback {

    override fun onMethodCall(call: Session.MethodCall) {
        // Handle onMethodCall
    }

    override fun onStatus(status: Session.Status) {
        // Handle session status
    }
}
```

````kotlin
walletConnectButton.sessionCallback = this
````

## Transactions

In order to perform a transaction you just need to call the `performTransaction` method. This method
is a `suspend` function so, you need to call it inside a `coroutine`.

````kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    runCatching { walletConnectKit.performTransaction(toAddress, value) }
        .onSuccess { /* Handle onSuccess */ }
        .onFailure { /* Handle onFailure */ }
}
````

**Note:** If you want to perform a transaction through a smart contract function, you need to pass
the encoded function data of the smart contract to the `data` parameter of the `performTransaction`
function.

## Sign

If you only want to sign a message, you can use the `personalSign` method.

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    runCatching { walletConnectKit.personalSign(message) }
        .onSuccess { /* Handle onSuccess */ }
        .onFailure { /* Handle onFailure */ }
}
```

## Advanced

If you don't want to use the `WalletConnectKitButton` and want to create your own implementation,
you can still use the `WalletConnectKit` to manage the connection between your DApp and Wallet.

Below are the most relevant methods provided by the `WalletConnectKit` that you need to care about:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td><b>createSession(callback: Session.Callback)</b></td>
<td>Creates a session and stores it locally. After calling this method you should receive a `Session.Status.Connected` in the passed callback. This is where you should call the `requestHandshake` method (see below).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>removeSession()</b></td>
<td>Removes the current session and cleans everything related to it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>loadSession(callback: Session.Callback)</b></td>
<td>Loads the session that is stored locally.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>isSessionStored</b></td>
<td>A flag that tells you if there is any session stored locally.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>session</b></td>
<td>Returns the current session or null otherwise.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>address</b></td>
<td>Returns the approved account address or null otherwise.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>requestHandshake()</b></td>
<td>Starts an intent that performs the handshake between your DApp and a Wallet.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>openWallet()</b></td>
<td>Starts an intent that opens a Wallet.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
